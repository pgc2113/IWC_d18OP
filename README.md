# IWC-δ¹⁸Oₚ Analysis
These series of notebooks provide jupyter notebooks to recreate the main three figures and analyses in "Influence of the Indian Walker Circulation on δ¹⁸Oₚ and precipitation variability in the Indian Ocean Basin".
## Repository Structure
### Conda Environment
The provided IWC_Isotopes.yml file will set up the necessary conda environment to execute the series of notebooks.
### Indian Ocean Basin Map
This code establishes the foundation for the Indian Ocean Basin maps used in generating Figure 1. The resulting output was imported into Affinity Designer to craft schematics illustrating the Indian Walker Circulation. 
### Spatio-Temporal Analysis
This notebook conducts the spatio-temporal analysis of δ¹⁸Oₚ and IWC/PWC. This notebook creates the foundation for Figure 2 and Figure S2 as well as the results from Table S1.
